      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Michaela, and for the past 5 years I've been working as a nanny in Minneapolis. I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in Early Childhood Education in 2014. Soon after graduating I realized that being a preschool teacher wasn't my dream job. I spent the following years doing some soul searching and researching various graduate degree programs, trying to decide what my dream job ACTUALLY is, and now here I am, about to begin a Coding Bootcamp and really switch things up.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>West Bend, WI</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p> I love to hike, backpack, and travel. I'm currently on a quest to see every national park in the United States. I also love to garden, cook and play RPGs.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a front end web developer working remotely while I travel the world.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Minneapolis</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm interested in becoming a web developer because I'm interested in the design aspect of building web pages. I want to make beautiful, easy to use web pages that make users happy to use. I'm also excited about the prospect of being able to eventually work remotely and possibly do some freelance work.</p>
